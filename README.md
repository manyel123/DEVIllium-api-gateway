# DEVIllium-api-gateway
API Gateway for DEVIllium website

This API Gateway uses JavaScript with Node JS environment and GraphQL server(Apollo Server). This service will allow DEVIllium's frontend to interact with multiple microservices developed with different tools and languajes.

For now, DEVIllium uses two main microservices, the first one DEVIllium-Users-ms is used for user management, registry and login. The second one DEVIllium-services used to manage contact forms, messages(user to user) and developer publications.
